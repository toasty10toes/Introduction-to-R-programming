# Introduction-to-R-programming

Welcome! This repository will help you get started with R and RStudio for data analysis. It includes step-by-step setup instructions and example R projects to introduce basic data manipulation and visualization, using biological/environmental data examples.

## Installing R

The following instructions to download R and RStudio are only applicable if you are using a personal laptop.
If you are using a government laptop, please contact IT to download R and RStudio if it is not already installed. 

You need to install R — the programming language — and RStudio — an integrated development environment for using R. Both are free. Install R first, then RStudio.
Follow the directions for whatever operating system you are working under. 

**Windows:**

  1. Go to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (https://cran.r-project.org/).
  2. Click “Download R for Windows”.
  3. Click “base” (for the base system).
  4. Finally, download the latest R installer (the link will say something like “Download R x.x.x for Windows”) and run the .exe installer.
  5. Follow the setup instructions (you can accept default options).

**macOS:**

  1. Go to Comprehensive R Archive Network (https://cran.r-project.org/).
  2. Click “Download R for (Mac) OS X”. 
  3. Download the latest R .pkg file for macOS and open it.
  4. Follow the installer steps to install R (defaults are fine)
     On some macOS versions, you may need to drag the R app into your Applications folder

## Installing R Studio
   1. Go to the official RStudio webpage (http://posit.co/downloads/).
   2. Hit the 'Download RStudio' button (the webpage usually detects your operating system). 
   3. Run the RStudio installer and follow the prompts to install.

**Note:** You must install R before installing RStudio
Once both R and RStudio are installed, open RStudio to begin using R. (If RStudio asks you to install any recommended packages on first launch, you can accept.)

## Downloading this Repository (Without Git)

  3. In the dropdown, choose “Download ZIP”
  4. Save the ZIP file to your computer, then unzip it (extract all files). This will create a folder containing the repository files.

You can now open the example R project files in RStudio!

## Getting Started with R: Example Projects
This repository includes two example files to practice basic R skills. Open these in RStudio and step through the code and comments:

## Online Resources
There are many free online resources for learning R. Here are some good ones.
